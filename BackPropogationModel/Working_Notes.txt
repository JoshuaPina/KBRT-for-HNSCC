These are notes I took while creating the model. I wanted to keep track of the decisions I made and why I made them.
I also wanted to track any issues I ran into, that this information may help us as we move forward.

Notes/Things I did:
1. Needed to decide what kind of data to use for CT iamges. One image? An average of all slices? The middle? I went with the average, as it'll be the most encompassing of each patient. I also needed to connect patients with their images. All this is done in preprocess_avg_ct.py. It also logs how many slices are used to produce each patients' average, just for the sake of knowing.
2. Decided what sort of data will be used, for what sort of data must be found. In this case, the demographic data (smoking, age, etc) and the CT image averages will act as inputs. The target variable will be the plan information (treatment dose, number of fractions, dose per fraction)
3. Skipping over patients whom we do not have ct images for. Their data is not considered in the training of the model - perhaps could be used as test set? 
4. Encoding a few features (like Smoking status) to binary, while also keeping numerical values. Which features should we select, which targets should we select?
5. Removed patient 253 for Missing values (??) - Patient 253 has values ommitted. I think this reduces the reliability of the dataset.
