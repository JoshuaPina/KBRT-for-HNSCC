# KBRT-HNSCC

**Knowledge-Based Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)**

## Overview

This project explores the application of knowledge-based radiotherapy (KBRT) models to improve treatment planning for head and neck cancer (specifically HNSCC). By combining mathematical modeling and machine learning, we aim to optimize dose distribution and reduce treatment-related toxicity, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
