# KBRT-HNSCC

**Knowledge-Based Radiotherapy for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)**

## Overview

This project explores the application of knowledge-based radiotherapy (KBRT) models to improve treatment planning for head and neck cancer (specifically HNSCC). By combining mathematical modeling and machine learning, we aim to optimize dose distribution and reduce treatment-related toxicity, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## üßë‚ÄçüöÄ Team

We are an interdisciplinary student research team bringing together expertise in mathematics, bioinformatics, computer science, and data science.

## Goals

- Develop and validate a KBRT model specifically for HNSCC cases.
- Compare model-predicted vs. actual clinical dose distributions.
- Explore integrating ML-based predictions with traditional mechanistic models.
- Share reproducible code and visualizations for the research community.

## Full Tech Stack

- Python
  - Scikit-learn
  - PyTorch
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - XGBoost  
- MATLAB 
- Streamlit 

Consideration for using Azure, and for future expansion, converting Streamlit to a full-stack application.

##  Development Environment

This project uses [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to ensure a consistent, reproducible development setup.

--- 

### Quick Start

1. **Open in Codespaces**  
   Click the green **Code** button on this repository, then choose **Open with Codespaces** ‚Üí **New codespace**.

2. **Automatic setup**  
   The dev container will automatically install Python and all required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

3. **Activate the environment**  
   When your Codespace starts, you‚Äôre ready to run scripts and notebooks immediately.
